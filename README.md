# -PROJECT- Weather Station

The following code was made in order to create a small weather station, based on the PIC18F2550 microcontroller.

The main idea of the project was to take variables from the environment, store them in a micro SD card, as well as send the information to thingspeak.

thingspeak = Data collection in the cloud with advanced data analysis using MATLAB.

the modules used for the project were tested separately, being these:
ADS1115 = 16-bit analog digital converter ADC, with I2C communication method.
BPM180 = Digital barometric pressure sensor module, with I2C communication method.
DHT22 = temperature and relative humidity sensor.
DS1307 = Real Time Clock.
esp8266 = Used as WiFi module.
SD = Module for reading and writing a Micro SD card.

mai = complete Proyect.
